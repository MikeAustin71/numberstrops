// CalendarSpec - An enumeration of calendar designations or types.
// CalendarSpec is used to designate the specific calendar applied
// to a date time operation.
//
// Since Go does not directly support enumerations, the 'CalendarSpec'
// type has been adapted to function in a manner similar to classic
// enumerations. 'CalendarSpec' is declared as a type 'int'. The method
// names effectively represent an enumeration of calendar specification
// types. These methods are listed as follows:
//
//
// None             (0) - None - Signals that the Calendar Specification
//                        (CalendarSpec) Type is not initialized. This is
//                        an error condition.
//
// Gregorian        (1) - Gregorian signals that the Gregorian Calendar is
//                        specified and in effect.
//
//                        The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used for
//                        civilian and commercial purposes throughout most
//                        of the world. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII,
//                        who introduced it Friday, 15 October 1582.
//
// Julian           (2) - Julian signals that the Julian Calendar is specified
//                        and in effect.
//
//                        The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 708
//                        Ab urbe condita (AUC) (46 BC), was a reform of the Roman
//                        calendar. It took effect on 1 January 709 AUC (45 BC),
//                        by edict. It was designed with the aid of Greek mathematicians
//                        and Greek astronomers such as Sosigenes of Alexandria.
//
//                        The calendar was the predominant calendar in the Roman
//                        world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in
//                        the Americas and elsewhere, until it was gradually
//                        replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582
//                        by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian calendar is still used
//                        in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church and in parts of
//                        Oriental Orthodoxy as well as by the Berbers.

//                        between the naming of dates sanctioned by those Eastern
//                        Orthodox churches adopting it and the Gregorian calendar
//                        that has come to predominate worldwide. This calendar was
//                        intended to replace the ecclesiastical calendar based on
//                        the Julian calendar hitherto in use by all of the Eastern
//                        Orthodox Church. From 1 March 1600 through 28 February 2800,
//                        the Revised Julian calendar aligns its dates with the Gregorian
//                        calendar, which was proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII
//                        for adoption by the Christian world. The calendar has been
//                        adopted by the Orthodox churches of Constantinople, Albania,
//                        Alexandria, Antioch, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, and Romania.

//                        solar year of 365.2421897 days and experiences a 1-day calendar

//
// The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425
// days long, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is
// determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The rule
// for leap years is:
//
// Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year,
// except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these
// centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible
// by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not
// leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.
//
//
// In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken
// into account to identify leap years:
//
// The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
//
// If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
// unless...
//
// The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
//
//
// According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
// while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.

//
// The Julian calendar has two types of year: a normal year of 365 days

// years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 days long.
// That is more than the actual solar year value of 365.24219 days, which

//
// Future versions of this calendar may incorporate a sliding scale
// mean solar year to account for variances in the earth's rotational

//
// "While Matt Parker came up with this system on his own, he does
// acknowledge that British mathematician Adam P. Goucher had suggested
// the idea before. Parker suggests a second alternative — that we go
// back to the Julian calendar, but adjust it so that we skip one leap
// day every 128 years. This system would have it so that the calendar
// would only be off by a day every 625,000 years; essentially, humankind
// would go half a million years before we drifted a day.
//
// Admittedly, calculating what year makes for every 128 years isn’t the
// easiest, so Parker takes it one step further, suggesting we just write
// all our years in binary. If the last seven digits of a binary year are
// zeros, then we skip the leap year. This year is 11111100000 in binary,
// so we’re good."
